title: What I learned from working on a game every day for 30+ days

As of writing my github commit streak is 37 days. I didn't start out thinking about trying to work on something everyday - I just wanted to work on a game in unity. However, I guess I got a little bit carried away, but I learned a ton in the process. 

A little bit of background: I was the TA for a game design course in college and I taught my students how to use Unity as well as Maya. So, I had a little bit of previous knowledge of Unity (however Unity 3 which I would argue is quite different). Also, while I was responsible for teaching students how to 3D model in Maya almost every single one of my students was better at it than I was. I could teach the pieces, but I struggled to put them together. 

When I was an undergrad I had actually taken the same game design course except using UE3 and Maya. Even then my models were a disaster - horrifyingly so (as I am told by my friend wilkie he still has nightmares about my creepy pacman mesh). Needless to say I thought that my attempts to 3D model again would also be terrible.

The thing is they were.

However the cool thing about working on it every day is that I got the chance to try and improve every single day. Eventually, I tried to make an effort to make sure to have at least one commit on the game every single day. 

As of writing this is pretty much where it stands:

The key for me to learning and making progress was dealing with the fact that I would suck and working every day to improve it.
